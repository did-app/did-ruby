# My App

This example application uses [DID.app](https://did.app) for passwordless authentication.

To start it you will need to create an application on DID.app and then use the client credentials when starting this rails app.

To start:

```
CLIENT_ID=test_123 CLIENT_SECRET=test_123456 ./bin/rails server
```
